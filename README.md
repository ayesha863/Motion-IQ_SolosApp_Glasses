# Solosapp ‚Äì Data Fetcher for Smart Glasses

**Solos** is a lightweight and efficient Android-based app designed for **smart glasses**. It collects sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) directly from the glasses and streams it to a **RabbitMQ server** for real-time **Human Activity Recognition (HAR)**.

---

## üöÄ Features

* üëì Real-time **smart glasses sensor data transmission**
* üß† Seamless integration with activity recognition pipelines
* üêá **RabbitMQ** message brokering for reliable streaming
* üíª Java-based backend consumer for data handling

---

## üì¶ How to Use

1. Configure the RabbitMQ server‚Äôs **IP address** and **port** in the Solos app.
2. Select the sensors available on the smart glasses.
3. Tap **Start** to begin streaming data in real time.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Ensure proper setup of RabbitMQ and consumer scripts before starting.

  ```
* Access UI at: `http://localhost:15672`

### 2. Create User

* Username: `test`
* Password: `test`
* Tags: `administrator`
* Note: Guest users cannot connect remotely.

### 3. Java Consumer Setup

**Required files:**

* `SensorDataConsumer.java`
* `amqp-client-5.21.0.jar`
* `slf4j-api-2.0.13.jar`
* `slf4j-simple-2.0.13.jar`

**Run steps:**

```bash
javac SensorDataConsumer.java
java SensorDataConsumer
```

### 4. Firewall

Open ports **15672** and **5672** in Windows Firewall.
